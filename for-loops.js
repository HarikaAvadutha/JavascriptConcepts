/*
The For/Of Loop
for/of lets you loop over data structures that are iterable such as Arrays, Strings, Maps, NodeLists, and more.

Note: If you use 'for/in' for arrays it will give indexes instead of values

The For/In Loop
The JavaScript for/in statement loops through the properties of an object
// for..in loops over both own and inherited keys

The forEach() method calls a function once for each element in an array, in order.

Note: the function is not executed for array elements without values.

Syntax: array.forEach(function(currentValue, index, arr), []thisValue)
